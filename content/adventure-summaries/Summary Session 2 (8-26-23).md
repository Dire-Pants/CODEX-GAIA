# Intro:
The adventure continues in the [[../major-locations/The Skyshards|Skyshards]], with the party flying their newly commandeered airship [[../~dm-pending/~pending-lore/The Bright Eye]] back to the [[../~dm-pending/~pending-lore/Lansraad]] capital city of [[../major-locations/Dol Solara]]. Their experiences during the expedition leave a number of disturbing questions unanswered, and there is a tense atmosphere aboard *The Bright Eye* as everyone wonders what will happen to this newly formed, ragtag group as the expedition concludes.

Taking advantage of the quiet flight back to civilization, [[../player-characters_active/Giuseppe]] rests and casts *Identify* on himself in an attempt to reveal the secrets of the mysterious cracked orb. He learns, and shares with the party, that the orb is compressed and solidified natural, [[../~dm-pending/~pending-lore/planar energy]] that was formed using mixed high level magics, though it appears that the damage has rendered it completely inert. The forming magics are too powerful for [[../player-characters_active/Giuseppe]] to understand (or completely alien compared to Gaian magics) which, similar to the expedition as a whole, introduces a number of unanswered questions.

[[../~dm-pending/~pending-lore/The Bright Eye]] approaches [[../major-locations/Dol Solara]]'s airborne checkpoints, the ship flying much smoother now under the guiding powers of [[../player-characters_inactive/Wither]] and [[Ashling]] and the steady hands of [[../player-characters_active/Skaaldir Jülrun|Skaaldir]]. It seems like [[../non-player-characters/Rook Brightscales|Rook]] and [[../non-player-characters/Bishop Moonwalker|Bishop]] have not yet returned, and the queue of ships at the checkpoints is short.
# Events:

- The party returned to [[../major-locations/Dol Solara]] on the [[../~dm-pending/~pending-lore/Bright Eye]] and used minor magics, illusions, and persuasion to weasel through the customs checkpoint.

- Everyone split up into small groups to earn some money and search for [[../non-player-characters/Rook Brightscales|Rook]] and [[../non-player-characters/Bishop Moonwalker|Bishop]] to demand payment.

- Rook, [[../non-player-characters/Bishop Moonwalker|Bishop]], and the [[../~dm-pending/~pending-lore/Sable Wing]] were nowhere to be found.

- [[../player-characters_inactive/Theodora Copperpeak|Theo]], Valkyrie, and [[../player-characters_inactive/West]] robbed a nobleman for 4 gold and [[../player-characters_inactive/Fran Velvetina|Fran]] sold a few poultices for 10 silver.

- As night falls, everyone is ambushed by mysterious robed figures similar to the cult members they encountered in the [[../major-locations/The Skyshards|Skyshards]] that Rook identified.
	- Despite their valiant resistance and several kills, everyone (except [[../player-characters_inactive/Fran Velvetina|Fran]], the party animal) is captured alive and imprisoned.
	- [[../player-characters_inactive/Fran Velvetina|Fran]], sensing [[../player-characters_active/Giuseppe|Giuseppe's]] Friends-light activating, finds the prison and follows a group of strangers performing a prison break.
	- The party escapes with the help of [[../player-characters_inactive/Fran Velvetina|Fran]] and the group of strangers and are led to the hideout of [[../~dm-pending/~pending-lore/the Black Crown]].

- The party meets [[../non-player-characters/Kaida Shimmerwing|Kaida]] (the Shimmerwing), a fairy and leader of [[../~dm-pending/~pending-lore/the Black Crown]], who links the strange events happening throughout [[../~dm-pending/~pending-lore/Aurelia]] and [[../~dm-pending/~pending-lore/Ignia]] and tells the party that their encounter in the [[../major-locations/The Skyshards|Skyshards]] is not an isolated event after hearing the party’s story of their expedition.

- The party learns that the cultist group is embedded within Gaian society and, according to Kaida, are trying to summon a dark power so they can assume control over [[../lore-and-history/Introduction to Gaia|Gaia]]. Kaida also says that the cult will continue to hunt the party because of their involvement with disrupting the portal ceremony, and she offered some level of support and protection if the party agrees to work for [[../~dm-pending/~pending-lore/the Black Crown]]

- Eventually and after much argument, the party agrees to work for the Black Crown as mercenaries once the Black Crown offered legal protection and future payment.

- There seems to be deep mistrust on both side, and Kaida refused to elaborate much on the Black Crown’s dealings. She also did not elaborate on her interest in the mysterious cult, other than indicating that she did not want to cede power to a new underground organization. It is still unclear why she wants to work with the party, other than the fact that she and they now have a shared enemy.

- Following this agreement, Kaida offers up the Black Crown’s barracks and resources for the party to rest and replenish supplies. She also provides help and funds to legally register the Bright Eye.

## Notable Role-Playing:
- Special kudos to [[../player-characters_active/Skaaldir Jülrun|Skaaldir]] for his excellent captainship and coordination of the crew during times of need.
