# Intro:
Half a day has passed since the ambush at the Dol Solara airship yard and Giuseppe’s kidnapping. The party is racing after the mysterious black airship on a desperate rescue mission, but are struggling to gain ground. The enemy started by flying straight south before starting to slowly veer eastwards into the afternoon.

On the ship with the party is Woadie, a shapeshifter and agent of the Black Crown. After describing the carnage wreaked on the Crown by the black dragon during the ambush, he mentioned seeing an airship rise from the rim of the Chasm to pursue the dragon into the Skyshards. His description of the airship matches that of the Sable Wing, Rook and Bishop’s ship. Unfortunately, the dragon flew north into the Skyshards while the black airship flew south, so the party cannot investigate this development.

The afternoon wanes, and time feels to be slipping away as the party struggles to increase their speed and find their quarry.
# Events:
- A combined effort from Aisling, Woadie, and West’s new powers resulted in a flying speed boost that nearly doubled the base speed of The Bright Eye
- As the party caught up with their enemy crewing the mysterious black airship, a fight breaks out among Woadie and some members of the party
- Woadie, taking insult from something West said, transforms into his wild shape of a brown bear and begins raging
- Combat ensues, with West landing the opening blow using an enchantment designed to pin Woadie in place, while Harold and Woadie begin duking it out in a spectacular display of strength
- Some members of the party try to use magic or wit to end the conflict with no success, eventually reaching a climax as Red draws his sword and comes to Woadie’s defense, trying to subdue West
- Theo eventually is able to calm Woadie enough to end combat after Woadie was substantially weakened by attacks from Harold and West
- Sensing the commotion, the enemy airship turns sharply to engage The Bright Eye. Skaaldir begins evasive maneuvers from the helm and Theo casts Fog Cloud in an attempt to mask the party’s approach
- A massive battle begins between the two airships and ballista, arrows, and fire bolts start flying through the air and magical fog
- As the two ships close on each other, Skaaldir sees an opportunity in the enemy ship’s broadside strafe and performs a ramming maneuver, crunching the two ships together and temporarily disabling the enemy ship’s movement
- Party members (and Woadie, back in human form) begin diving through the cloud of fog and leaping onto the enemy ship, laying waste to the undead enemy crew
- As fighting breaks out on the enemy ship’s lower deck, Morg and Valkyrie dive bomb the black robed magicians while Skaaldir and Theo frantically fight fires on The Bright Eye and provide cover fire for their allies
- The battle on the enemy ship devolves into absolute mayhem - fires break out and spread across the deck, Woadie transforms back into a bear and begins tossing enemies overboard, Wither transforms into a wolf and starts chomping, and Fran, West, and Aisling execute a (somewhat) coordinated rescue of Giuseppe from the lower hold
- The enemy is slowly reduced to a single combatant: a plate-armored warrior wielding a massive greatsword
- Party members weave through the flames, trading blows with the enemy captain and providing cover for Giuseppe and his rescuers
- Red, Wither, Woadie, Harold, and West, battered and bleeding, finally bring down their foe and West verifies the kill with a powerful blow to the head, crushing helmet and skull 
- The party is able to escape the burning ship, with Aisling pulling Giuseppe to safety and Red dragging the corpse of the slain captain
- Skaaldir is able to maneuver the ships apart and flies to safety and, as the session comes to a close, West psionically strikes out at Red in retaliation to Red’s previous attack on West during the conflict with Woadie
- Red, severely weakened from the fight with the enemy captain, is knocked unconscious for a brief moment until Aisling force feeds him magical berries to stabilize him
- West uses the opportunity to coldly say he leaves no attack unanswered, and shows his displeasure at the imbalance and unpredictability he senses within Red
- Red, a holy warrior and defender of his allies, has now lost connection to his god and the trust of a companion, whether deserved or not

# Character Interactions:
- Aisling transformed into her wild shape for the first time - a magnificent, wolf-sized fox
- Fran showed off her new alchemical concoction: psychedelic dust
- Harold became friends, or at least battle companions, with Woadie after a healthy session of axe-and-claw fighting
- Morg displayed new abilities with reflecting and absorbing spells using her jade eye
- Red continues to struggle to find a sense of purpose in this land of Gaia and used new abilities based on fear and necromancy, which seemed to make him a specific target of the enemy captain for reasons unknown
- Skaaldir continues to follow his path of redemption as he chooses diplomacy over violence (sometimes with limited success) and his allies’ lives over his material goods
- Theo can’t stop her bloodlust in combat as her body count rises
- West started to emerge from his anti-social shell, but only to show that he brooks no violence upon his person nor any perceived imbalance in the world around him. He also wielded new magical and psionic powers
- Wither held a heated conversation with no visible entity that culminated into her screaming “No!” several times before leaping into combat
# Character Highlights:
- Aisling channeled magic energy from West and within herself to boost The Bright Eye to dangerously high speeds
- Fran assisted Giuseppe in the rescue operation and tried out her new mixture on the worst possible test subject: an animated skeleton
- Harold, in a rare show of restraint, did not throw his axe away at the first sign of combat
- Morg reflected fire bolts left and right, and pecked out a magician’s eye
- Red was forced to make a difficult choice when his allies began fighting amongst each other, and chose Woadie over West
- Skaaldir made a daring and risky play by ramming the enemy airship
- Theo used her animal handling skills to soothe Woadie in his wild form
- West defended himself (with force) against Woadie, and also acted against Red with a delayed, surprise retaliatory attack after the fighting ended
 * Wither chomped enemy bones left and right as a ferocious wolf

# Notable Role-Playing:
 I think everyone deserves commendations on the dedication with roleplaying your characters. A large group of adventurers is bound to fight amongst each other as decisions are made and relationships wane and wax, and I think there were a lot of good discussions and choices based on character motivations. I’m excited to see how things unfold next session!
