# Intro:
A week has passed since the cultist attacks, the party’s imprisonment, and the subsequent rescue operation by the Black Crown. The criminal organization has shown a grudging hospitality, allowing the party to rest and resupply and receive treatment from the gang’s healers. Despite having restricted access to most of the hideout and being under constant surveillance, the party has seen the depth and power of the criminal organization. Military captains, political figures, and wealthy business owners all come to meet with the [[../non-player-characters/Kaida Shimmerwing|Shimmerwing]] or send runners with payments in the form of coin or information. Many also come as supplicants, begging for another chance, another month, another loan. It’s clear that the Black Crown is s[[../major-locations/Dol Solara|Solara]]taking control of Dol [[../major-locations/Dol Solara|Solara]], filling the vacuum left from the army’s march south.

There is a certain order to the chaos within the hideout. Rules are clearly being followed, and a perceptive individual will see an unspoken code of conduct behind the interactions between gang members. The [[../non-player-characters/Kaida Shimmerwing|Shimmerwing]] seems to rule with a subtle hand, though she dispenses justice with an iron fist. The party occasionally hears muffled cries from what appear to be torture chambers, and many gang members sport faded and fresh bloodstains on their undergarments, visible only in the hideout when they remove their black leathers. Snippets of conversations have led the party to believe that killings are all too frequent as the power dynamic of Dol [[../major-locations/Dol Solara|Solara]] shifts.

The [[../non-player-characters/Kaida Shimmerwing|Shimmerwing]] has called a meeting in the Black Crown’s war room, and rumor has it that she plans to send out several crews to investigate events throughout [[../~dm-pending/~pending-lore/Aurelia]]. She has recalled some of her most deadly agents who have recently arrived at the hideout with their crews. Excitement hums through the hideout as the Black Crown grunts and leaders alike prepare for an unprecedented deployment of force beyond Dol Solara’s walls.
# Events:
The party met with the [[../non-player-characters/Kaida Shimmerwing|Shimmerwing]] and her lieutenants to discuss the rising conflicts throughout [[../~dm-pending/~pending-lore/Aurelia]] and [[../~dm-pending/~pending-lore/Ignia]].

The [[../non-player-characters/Kaida Shimmerwing|Shimmerwing]] commanded the party to travel south and investigate events in the Twisted Green, despite their request to fly east to [[../~dm-pending/~pending-lore/Ignia]] and help the dwarves and gnomes while her two lieutenants investigate the other two events.

The expedition parties met at the airship docks at dawn to receive their final mission briefings and prepare for flight.

Just before the party received their briefing, a mysterious black airship accompanied by a young black dragon ambushed the departing crews.

Aisling noticed that the dragon was focused on subduing and distracting the [[../~dm-pending/~pending-lore/the Black Crown|Black]] [[../~dm-pending/~pending-lore/the Black Crown|Crown]] while agents from the enemy airship descended upon the [[../~dm-pending/~pending-lore/Bright Eye|Bright]] Eye.

The party fought off the enemies, but could not save [[../player-characters_active/Giuseppe]] from being kidnapped by a black-armored warrior.

The party decided to cast off and pursue [[../player-characters_active/Giuseppe]] and his kidnapper despite the [[../non-player-characters/Kaida Shimmerwing|Shimmerwing]] commanding them back to the Dol [[../major-locations/Dol Solara|Solara]] docks.

Right before the party flew away, the [[../~dm-pending/~pending-lore/the Black Crown|Black]] [[../~dm-pending/~pending-lore/the Black Crown|Crown]] agent Woadie leapt aboard the ship in bear form and transformed back into his human shape.

As the party began their aerial chase in the [[../~dm-pending/~pending-lore/Bright Eye|Bright]] Eye, Woadie recounted the fight with the dragon, telling the party that the [[../~dm-pending/~pending-lore/the Black Crown|Black]] [[../~dm-pending/~pending-lore/the Black Crown|Crown]] took dozens of casualties and that the Freeman was grievously wounded. He also said that the Shimmering and the Captain would quickly regroup and send out a single expedition under the Captain’s command, although he doesn’t know what their destination will be.
