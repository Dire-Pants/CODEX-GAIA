# Intro
<font color="#ff0000">**PENDING INFO**</font>

# Events:
The party separated into individuals and small groups the night after Giuseppe’s rescue to treat the wounded, repair the ship, find a moment of quiet, or deal with inner demons.

The next day, everyone held a meeting on the deck of the airship, the Bright Eye, to talk about where to go next.

A decision was made to fly south to the Lansraad Outpost at the edge of the Twisted Green to seek medical help and airship repair supplies.

During the flight south, Aisling carved herself an oaken staff from spare planks, Wither and Red performed a cleansing ritual on the airship with burning sage, Morg bonded with Valkyrie, and everyone else either worked on repairing the Bright Eye or spent some introspection time.

After a three day flight, the party saw smoke in the distance and landed the airship to investigate, nearly crashing the ship in an uncontrolled descent due to the damage dealt to the ship’s hull during the previous air battle.

Skaaldir stayed aboard the Bright Eye to watch the ship and protect Giuseppe, Harold, and Fran while the rest of the party left to investigate the distant campsite.

The investigating group discovered a war party of centaurs traveling south, and learned that the centaurs were going to help fight a strange blight coming from the Twisted Green and spreading north.

West’s conversation with a nearby tree corroborated the centaur chieftain’s story of this strange blight on the land, and possibly a greater disease growing within all of Gaia.

The party spent the night in the centaur camp and spend the following day traveling south. 

Meanwhile, Skaaldir managed (eventually) to repair the small nick in the airship’s levitation ring, though he was accidentally drugged with one of Fran’s alchemical powders after he recruited her to help in the repair effort.

Skaaldir flew (physically, mentally, and emotionally) south and rendezvoused with the rest of the party, hitting a couple hills on the way.

West remained on foot with the centaur column while the rest of the party boarded the Bright Eye and flew south, eventually reaching the Lansraad Outpost.

Soon after arriving, and before they could speak with the commanding officer, the outpost was attacked by a large group of thorn and vine creatures who emerged without warning from the dense jungle of the Twisted Green.

Combat ensued, and after a flurry of spells, flaming arrows, swinging swords, slashing paws, entangling vines, whizzing thorns, showers of urine, showers of poison, galloping centaurs, a galloping elf, piercing beaks, and prosthetic projectiles, the party defeated the blighted plants.

The well trained Lansraad army also successfully thwarted the larger floral attack, and the party sensed that these raids are a common occurrence.

Woadie, enraged by Skaaldir’s mushroom-induced deception and urinary assault, continued his rampage until Red and Aisling managed to calm him down.

As the session came to a close and the party regrouped after the attack, they saw something in the far distance: a humanoid figure briefly flying up from the dense jungle canopy on what appeared to be a broomstick.

# Character Interactions:
Aisling displayed a proficiency in woodcarving and uses a set of well-worn tools.

The party saw the strength of the unusual bond between Harold and Francesca as the sprite treated the infected battle wounds of her hairless dwarf companion.

Giuseppe relapsed into a mysterious coma, causing some to wonder whether its source is magical or mundane.

Morg developed a crude form of telepathic connection with the eagle Valkyrie.

Red’s divine abilities seem to fluctuate from day to day, possibly caused by (or amplifying) his feeling of purposelessness, or possibly due to some other reason. He was also overheard weeping and speaking to his equipment, speaking the names Kit and Arya.

Skaaldir vehemently opposed flying to Ignia, suggesting his previously mentioned “path of redemption” may have some limits.

Theo can’t help but ogle the luscious rumps of female centaurs.

West seems to be powerfully affected by imbalance in the natural world and driven to restore balance. He also telepathically transmitted something to Skaaldir that greatly disturbed the dwarf rogue, suggesting a horrific event in West’s past.

Wither displayed an uncanny affinity with the wind when she summoned a powerful gust to land the damaged Bright Eye.
# Character Highlights:

Aisling blasted left, Aisling blasted right, Aisling blasted everything with her new magic wand.

Fran accidentally drugged Skaaldir with some experimental alchemy powder when she tried to help fix the levitation ring on the Bright Eye.

Morg channeled magical energy from her jade eye to propel the Bright Eye for a short distance.

Red challenged a raging, bear-form Woadie and eventually subdued him.

Skaaldir went on an accidental psychedelic journey that included:
	- Nearly crashing the Bright Eye into a hill. Twice
	- Antagonizing centaur warriors with some friendly, though unwelcome, rump slapping
	- Convincing Woadie he had mead, then proceeding to piss all over Woadie
	- Removing his prosthetic leg, loading it onto the ballista, and firing it at the vine monster leader (it’s important to note that he has to remove the actual ballista bolt in order to fire his prosthetic leg)
	- Running like a ninny when Woadie came for blood in revenge for his surprise golden shower

Theo briefly rode a centaur without getting attacked, which is no simple feat.
Theo, at home in the mountains and hills, successfully navigated and led the party to find the centaur camp.

West developed a rapport with a centaur war party after finding a common purpose of restoring natural balance
West charged into combat with the centaur war party, crying: “Centaurs! TO BATTLE!”

Wither summoned powerful gales and shockwaves, displaying a terrifying power that doesn’t always distinguish friend from foe
