# Intro:
The adventure begins on the continent of Aurelia in the bustling city of [[../major-locations/Dol Solara]]. Tensions among the gangs and expedition companies are rising as they rush to fill their ships’ crews following rumors of a new portal opening on the outskirts of the [[../major-locations/The Skyshards|Skyshards]]. There is also a sense of general unrest among the populace due to many [[../~dm-pending/~pending-lore/Lansraad]] soldiers and peacekeepers mobilizing in the south for unknown reasons, leaving Dol Solara sparsely guarded and policed.

Hands-for-hire postings and mercenary contract advertisements dot the walls everywhere in the city, promising fame and riches for anyone brave enough to fly into the [[../major-locations/The Skyshards|Skyshards]] in search of this rumored new treasure. The members of the party have all decided to sign up with [[../non-player-characters/Rook Brightscales|Rook]] [[../non-player-characters/Rook Brightscales|Brightscales]] and his crew, and all have gathered in The Snoring Giant Inn for their pre-expedition briefing. Few of you in the room know each other, or even know of each other, but you’ve all come to perform the same job, even if your reasons for doing so vary widely.
# Events:
- All party members made it onto the [[../~dm-pending/~pending-lore/Sable Wing]] Crew

- Various party members noticed suspicious behavior among the [Dragonborn](https://www.dndbeyond.com/races/16-dragonborn) and suspected something was afoot

- The party sucessfully saved an Aarakocra squadron despite [[../non-player-characters/Rook Brightscales|Rook]] and Bishop's reluctance

- The party sucessfully found a hidden cave on the [[../major-locations/The Skyshards|Skyshard]] Island

- The party defeated the cultist group in the cave system and stopped a mysterious ritual

- Conflict arose between Red and [[../non-player-characters/Rook Brightscales|Rook]] when [[../non-player-characters/Rook Brightscales|Rook]] recklessly used his breath weapon and applied friendly fire damage

- The missing Dragonborn crew arrive at the island afterwards and collect all the bodies

- The party discovers the cultist's airship and fly back to Dol [[../major-locations/Dol Solara|Solara]] under the magical control of Ashling and Wither, leaving the Dragonborn (and their wages) behind

- [[../player-characters_active/Giuseppe]] casts identify on himself after resting in Dol [[../major-locations/Dol Solara|Solara]] once the party returns from the adventure.
	- He senses that the cracked orb is a compressed and solidified form of [[../~dm-pending/~pending-lore/planar energy]] (the energy that forms portals) 
	- He also sensed a strange combination of high level magics present...magics that are either too powerful for him to understand or magics that do not originate from [[../lore-and-history/Introduction to Gaia|Gaia]]. 
	- The orb appears to be dormant, though it is unclear if that is an intentional or "broken" state
