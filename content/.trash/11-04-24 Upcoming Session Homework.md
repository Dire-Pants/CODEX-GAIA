## Tasks:
- <font color="#ff0000">TRAINING WHEELS ARE OFF! </font>
- Everyone has cards and tins and is (hopefully) becoming more comfortable with the game and role playing their character. 
- The combat rules will be different from here on out, and your homework is to familiarize yourself with your character’s abilities, equipment, and combat actions

## NEW COMBAT RULES! 
- We have a big group, and the combat rules will make things flow faster and really highlight the chaos of battle with such a big group. 
- At the beginning of each round, everyone will have 2 minutes to pick your action.
- When it’s your turn, you can decide your **movement** and your **bonus action** but you must use your selected action (even if it doesn’t make sense following someone else’s action before you). More will be explained on Saturday, but the TLDR version is that **combat will be timed**.
