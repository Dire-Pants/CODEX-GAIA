Gaia is a world of magic and technology. There are energy nodes throughout the world that can tap the world's energy. This energy fuels both magic and technology. Each geographic region has an [[energy node]], a place of natural magical power, that attracts people and creatures. Some have become hubs for each regionâ€™s culture centers and industries, both magical and technical. These nodes are also central points for numerous pseudo-religious groups that have coalesced over time into the now dominant religion whose followers are referred to as [[Followers of Gaia]] (Followers for shorthand). Past events birthed two opposing cults - the [[Stewards of Gaia]] and the [[Children of Gaia]] - that follow the general beliefs of the Followers.
