A somewhat recent development in the renaissance of [[The Second Age]]. With the dawn of this invention, people are only recently able to effectively spread further out, explore the world, study the history, and map everything they find. 

### Pending Info/Discovery Points:
- Who invented the Airships?
- How do they work?
- What is a standard crew like?
- Are there any notable historical ships?
- Are there any trade/military fleets?
