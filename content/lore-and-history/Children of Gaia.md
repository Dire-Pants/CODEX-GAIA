A cult opposed by the [[Stewards of Gaia]]. The Children (Sons and Daughters) view Gaia and energy nodes as a resource provided by the planet. Most pursue the scientific study and conservative usage of this resource. The radicalized wing of the Children pursue total exploitation of the planet and key sites, some for the “greater good” and some for personal gain.
