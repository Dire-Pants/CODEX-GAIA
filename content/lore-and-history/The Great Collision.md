A near apocalyptic event that effectively collapsed Gaian civilization and set it back hundreds, if not thousands, of years. This cataclysm was caused by a massive magical experiment by Gaian religious extremists on the [[../major-locations/Aurelian Prime]], the major energy well on Aurelia, to create an artificial power source using a natural energy well. The energy from this experiment warped space-time and forced many of the ethereal and material planes together, causing a massive dimensional collision.
