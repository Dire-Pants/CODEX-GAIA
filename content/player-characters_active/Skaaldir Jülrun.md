## Thief Archetype: Rogue
### Fast Hands

Starting at 3rd [level](https://dnd-wiki.org/w/index.php?title=SRD5:Level&action=edit&redlink=1 "SRD5:Level (page does not exist)") you can use the [bonus action](https://dnd-wiki.org/wiki/SRD5:Bonus_Action "SRD5:Bonus Action") granted by your [Cunning Action](https://dnd-wiki.org/wiki/SRD5:Cunning_Action "SRD5:Cunning Action") to make [Dexterity](https://dnd-wiki.org/wiki/SRD5:Dexterity "SRD5:Dexterity") ([Sleight of Hand](https://dnd-wiki.org/wiki/SRD5:Sleight_of_Hand "SRD5:Sleight of Hand")) [check](https://dnd-wiki.org/wiki/SRD5:Check "SRD5:Check"), use your [thieves’ tools](https://dnd-wiki.org/w/index.php?title=SRD5:Thieves%E2%80%99_Tools&action=edit&redlink=1 "SRD5:Thieves’ Tools (page does not exist)") to disarm a [trap](https://dnd-wiki.org/wiki/SRD5:Trap "SRD5:Trap") or open a [lock](https://dnd-wiki.org/w/index.php?title=SRD5:Lock&action=edit&redlink=1 "SRD5:Lock (page does not exist)"), or take the [Use an Object](https://dnd-wiki.org/wiki/SRD5:Use_an_Object "SRD5:Use an Object") [action](https://dnd-wiki.org/wiki/SRD5:Action "SRD5:Action"). 

### Second-Story Work

When you choose this archetype at <span style="background:#fff88f">3rd level</span>, you gain the ability to [climb](https://dnd-wiki.org/wiki/SRD5:Climb "SRD5:Climb") faster than normal; climbing no longer costs you extra [movement](https://dnd-wiki.org/wiki/SRD5:Movement "SRD5:Movement"). In addition, when you make a [running jump](https://dnd-wiki.org/w/index.php?title=SRD5:Running_Jump&action=edit&redlink=1 "SRD5:Running Jump (page does not exist)"), the distance you cover increases by a number of feet equal to your Dexterity modifier. 

### Supreme Sneak

By 9th level, you have [advantage](https://dnd-wiki.org/wiki/SRD5:Advantage "SRD5:Advantage") on a Dexterity ([Stealth](https://dnd-wiki.org/wiki/SRD5:Stealth "SRD5:Stealth")) check if you move no more than half your [speed](https://dnd-wiki.org/wiki/SRD5:Speed "SRD5:Speed") on the same [turn](https://dnd-wiki.org/wiki/SRD5:Turn "SRD5:Turn"). 

### Use Magic Device

By 13th level, you have learned enough about the workings of [magic](https://dnd-wiki.org/w/index.php?title=SRD5:Magic&action=edit&redlink=1 "SRD5:Magic (page does not exist)") that you can improvise the use of items even when they are not intended for you. You ignore all [class](https://dnd-wiki.org/wiki/SRD5:Class "SRD5:Class"), [race](https://dnd-wiki.org/wiki/SRD5:Race "SRD5:Race"), and level requirements on the use of [magic items](https://dnd-wiki.org/wiki/SRD5:Magic_Item "SRD5:Magic Item"). 

### Thief's Reflexes

When you reach 17th level, you have become adept at laying ambushes and quickly escaping danger. You can take **two** turns during the **first [round](https://dnd-wiki.org/wiki/SRD5:Round "SRD5:Round")** of any combat. You take your first turn at your normal [initiative](https://dnd-wiki.org/wiki/SRD5:Initiative "SRD5:Initiative") and your second turn at your initiative minus 10. You cannot use this feature when you are [surprised](https://dnd-wiki.org/wiki/SRD5:Surprised "SRD5:Surprised").
