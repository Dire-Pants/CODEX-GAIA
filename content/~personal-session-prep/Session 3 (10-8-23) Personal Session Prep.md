##### Session 3 Role Play Intro

I want to deeply apologize for the overkill of the cultist when being released from the cage


Morg got too many bumps on the head and I fear she may have a concussion. To date, she's my most valuable artifact yet.

My penchant for violence has subsided in my four decades..it's just..

The last time I was in a deep dank pit I barely made it out alive. Ive had flashbacks and terrors from the moment. That's how I got the nice souvenir I walk around with. I have to my leg and springs weekly or I turn into a rusty lump of petrified meat.


##### Revealed Backstory:
> Oath of Restoration: The dwarf has taken a solemn oath to make amends for their past actions by devoting their life to repairing the damage caused to Gaia. This flaw can result in an obsession with restoration, sometimes at the expense of other priorities or relationships. They may be compelled to protect nature, seek out ancient knowledge, or dedicate themselves to environmental causes.

Ran an illegal blast mining operation in Ignia.

Led a group of Gnomes on an expedition and ultimately to their deaths.

I had no respect for Gnomes in the past, yet on every operation I conscripted your services, your tiny fingers often lead to greatness. 

The memories of their wives and husbands wishing them well before the caving expedition is still burned into my mind. 

The Earth itself was vibrating and warning us not to push further, the heat we were experiencing was stifling. A group of Gnomes determined a good spot to blast to reach further into the depths bellow, we both sensed more behind a pocket of stone. I grew impatient. We blasted the area with dynamite and discovered a vein sitting along a river of lava. The vein was glowing similar to the energy you may see in the energy well of Aurelian Prime. Up to this point I had stuck to rare gemstones. My Greed got the best of me and I commanded the Gnomes to expend all of our dynamite along the glowing material and to get their bags ready to hand pick the crude material. 

What happened shortly after the blast is still fuzzy in my memory. I simply recollect the gnomes bodies strewn about all around me and the bellowing of a beast in the distance. My left leg was missing and I was losing a lot of blood. I cinched it off as fast as I could with my belt and painfully and desperately ascented up the path we had taken. 

Morgs call led me out of the cave that nearly killed me. I had nearly given up until she mimic'd the voice and dialect of elves, urging me to press on and telling me how close I was. Funny enough, she drew Gnomes to the entrance of the cave, the very same husbands and wives and they still begrudgingly nursed me back to health. 


Believe it or not, I still conducted my illegal operations for another decade, it was my way to survive. I stayed far away from that cave and would often warn any travelers or fellow Dwarve to stay away, as I am certain we came to bear witness on demons from deep within the Earth. Perhaps the same ones Explorers have witnessed when trying to chart the depths of The Circle.

I had to call it quits when I still witnessed echoes of my nefarious trade and business practices. After realizing my bulk gemstones were helping fund extremist actions and attacks on the villages surrounding me, I had to bring that chapter to an end. The damage they caused and the pollution my operations were causing really started to bring about untold suffering to the villagers and animals near where I operated. Those areas are not nearly as hospitable as they once were. 

I left the Ignia islands and moved closer to The Circle. I've been making ends meet by fostering relations and trade of goods in the canal but due to my less than squeaky clean record in illegal trade, many of the jobs i've had to do were for The Black Crown in a roundabout way. Honestly,  hunting the relics and artifacts may be the best gig I've gotten. Perhaps I can make sure the the amounts of damage that have been caused are never caused again..in fact. I would like to devote my life to making sure they aren't.
