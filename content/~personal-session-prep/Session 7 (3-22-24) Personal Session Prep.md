# Bring Up:

- I have enough infamy to atone for.
- I understand that since we left that accursed tavern with the dragonborne we have been fending for our very lives on a near constant basis.
- But I ask, are we privvy to acting before we think? Is diplomacy and mutual understanding a dead concept on this cursed rock?
- This..Cloud Captain..he landed on the bright eye and our defensive posture was warranted but I witnessed the provocation of chaos and loss in an instant.
- With the loss of I re-witnessed flashes of my dead workers strewn about when I witnessed the loss of Re and the dismemberment of this stranger. Re was the only one I would share my jerky rations with.
- As Morg is a comfort to me when no-one else will listen, I can only imagine the weight of Ashling's loss, this could have all been prevented with a little more patience. We were not sprung into an ambush.
- Do any of you know who this Cloud Captain was?
- I doubt i'll be able to wrest that broom for your hands loathsome bard, but I ask if you can use it to clean up this mess.

? How to interact with Wither
? How to interact with Aisling?
? How to interact with West?
