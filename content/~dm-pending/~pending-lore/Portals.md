Emerged during [[../../lore-and-history/The Great Collision]]. Over time as things passed through the [[../../lore-and-history/The Dark Age]] into the [[../../lore-and-history/The Second Age]] , it is reported that these portals have been slowly shrinking and disappearing over time. The reason for this is unknown at this time. Some of the largest and strongest still remain - some even speculate that they may be artificially maintained via magical means.
