The rings are imbuded with a magical engery that replenishes via the natural energies present on Gaia. In a sense, fuel/propulsion is basically infinite as long as the ship is not imprisoned or that energy is blocked. A magical user or creature can tap into the ring's energy and manipulate the energy field (similar to an electromagnetic field with a dipole) to create thrust in the desired direction.  This does not consume magical energy from a magic user, but it does occupy their attnetion.
