The Great Chasm, seemingly bottomless and 400 miles in radius, collapsed and formed [[The Skyshards]]. Some believe it to be a gateway to hell, as those rumored to have tried to rappel or fly down to its bottom have reported feeling increasingly warmer as they descended, and have been attacked by strange demonic creatures.
