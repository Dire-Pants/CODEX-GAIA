A project started by the dwarves of the east who live in [[../~dm-pending/~pending-lore/The Crescent]]. The Dwarves diverted all of the glacial rivers into a massive circular canal around [[The Great Chasm]]. The canal feeds off into the ocean on the west side of the continent of [[../~dm-pending/~pending-lore/Aurelia]].  Workers had to build and defend the canal in tandem due to the monsters coming out of the floating islands above. Many died during this 150 year project. Once this project was complete, cities began springing up and developing around the canal. This was a key historical point transitioning [[../lore-and-history/The Dark Age]] to the possibilities of [[../lore-and-history/The Second Age]]. Shared commerce among all the intelligent races floats up and down the canal via an advanced series of locks that control the water flow.
