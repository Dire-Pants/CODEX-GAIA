The capital city of the [[../~dm-pending/~pending-lore/Eastern Mining Consortium]] and the core of Aurelian geological research and technological innovation, Dol Bolero is located on the northeast rim of [[The Great Chasm]], though the real city can be found among the cavernous halls underground. Everything in this city is built from intricately carved stone, and the fires of the smelters and forges run day and night, causing the city to glow like an ember. The underground halls and markets are usually only open to dwarves or pass holders (those recognized by the Consortium as providing value to the dwarvish community), this part of the city is growing rapidly as more areas are excavated around the Chasm’s steep walls. Dol Bolero also serves as the control center for [[The Circle]], directing water flow from the [[Crescent Mountain]] glaciers into the Great Circle, the massive canal network girdling the Chasm.
