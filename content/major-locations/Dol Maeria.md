The capital city of the [[../~dm-pending/~pending-lore/Elysian Collective]] and a peaceful center of the arts and magical sciences, Dol Maeria is located on the western rim of [[The Great Chasm]] and is the easternmost point of the Collective’s territory that spans the entire western coast of Aurelia. Dol Maeria is unique in Aurelia as it has grown vertically (rather than the horizontal sprawl of Dol Solara) and features a collection of slender, needle-like towers of such beauty that traveling to this city is often referred to as a pilgrimage. Each tower houses students of a particular subject, ranging from magical transmutation to poetry to playwriting, and many elves of the city will spend months on end without ever leaving their tower. It should be noted that nearly all elves in the city are high elves, and wood elves prefer to live along the wooded [[Teardrop Cliffs]] on the western coast.
