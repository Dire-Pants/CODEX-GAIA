These awe-inspiring islands float in and above [[The Great Chasm]]  and are a popular destination for adventurers due to the high concentration of planar [[../~dm-pending/~pending-lore/Portals]] bringing in creatures, peoples, and artifacts from across the multiverse. The [[../lore-and-history/Aarakocra tribes]] have settled these islands and are usually indifferent towards explorers from the Aurelian cities, though many of these explorers have often been killed in skirmishes between the [[../lore-and-history/Aarakocra tribes]] and [[../~dm-pending/~pending-lore/Creature - Gargoyles]] . It is widely believed that the Skyshards were formed from the earth torn out of [[The Great Chasm]] during [[../lore-and-history/The Great Collision]].
