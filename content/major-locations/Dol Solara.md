The capital city of the [[../~dm-pending/~pending-lore/Lansraad]] and a bustling hub for adventurers, revelers, and criminals, Dol Solara sprawls along the southern rim of [[The Great Chasm]] and is the launching site for nearly all [[The Skyshards|Skyshard]] expeditions due to its numerous airship yards and booming artifact market. While most of the Laansrad holdings are primarily home to humans and halflings, this city is one of the most diverse in all of Gaia, though it also houses an extensive criminal underground comprised of several leading gangs, the largest being [[../~dm-pending/~pending-lore/the Black Crown]].
