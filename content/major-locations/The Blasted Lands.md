During [[../lore-and-history/The Great Collision]], this area may have been destroyed, along with the creation of [[The Great Chasm]].

Landing parties went here after airships were developed. These lands are extremely dangerous and extremely difficult to reach. Most expeditions have failed to return.

Surveying has begun recently and pathfinding groups have found that it is littered with craters and strange creatures.
