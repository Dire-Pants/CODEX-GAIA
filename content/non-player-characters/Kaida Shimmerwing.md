An unusual sight in Aurelia, Kaida is one of a few fairies who came through a portal from the Feywild to Gaia. Using her beauty, sharp wit, and skill with knives, she quickly established herself among the criminal underground of Dol Solara. She now leadsÂ the Black Crown and runs the largest artifact hunting operation with her fleet of airships. Most only know her by reputation, which is a curious mixture of generous and ruthless that oddly befits a crime boss of her standing. It is widely known that she has amicable relations with the military and political figures of the [[../~dm-pending/~pending-lore/Lansraad]] and many of her operations are run in open air now.
