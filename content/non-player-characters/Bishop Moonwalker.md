A silver-scaled Dragonborn and first mate to [[Rook Brightscales|Rook]], Bishop is a mysterious individual with a natural talent for magic. Silent and brooding, he is always at Rook’s shoulder but is never seen speaking or showing emotion to anyone but [[Rook Brightscales|Rook]]. His presence is known to cause unease among those nearby but that is often offset somewhat by Rook’s boisterous persona.
