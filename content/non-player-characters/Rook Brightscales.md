A golden-scaled Dragonborn and daring sky captain, Rook and his partner [[Bishop Moonwalker|Bishop]] run the most successful individually-owned expedition company aboard the airshipÂ [[../~dm-pending/~pending-lore/Dragonsong]]. He is charismatic and cunning, with a reputation as a brutal fighter. Little is known about his past, though it is assumed he came from one of the nomadic Dragonborn clans of the far north. His true name is even a mystery; he claims to be a master of chess and thus had been nicknamed Rook as a child despite that fact that no one has ever witnessed him playing. Anyone interacting with Rook will quickly sense a hardness in him that speaks of a violent past.
